OMG! There is a
 recently created a new company in the `GAMING industry` that wants to have a new office... somewhere all over the world (they are Spanish though).
 I have been chosen to find that wonderful place, and, for that, I have been told the company components and their interests...
 
 The company will have the following scheme:

- 20 Designers
- 5 UI/UX Engineers
- 10 Frontend Developers
- 15 Data Engineers
- 5 Backend Developers
- 20 Account Managers
- 1 Maintenance guy that loves basketball
- 10 Executives
- 1 CEO/President

And these are their preferences 

Designers like to go to design talks and share knowledge. There must be some nearby companies that also do design.
30% of the company have at least 1 child.
Developers like to be near successful tech startups that have raised at least 1 Million dollars.
Executives like Starbucks A LOT. Ensure there's a starbucks not to far.
Account managers need to travel a lot
All people in the company have between 25 and 40 years, give them some place to go to party.
The CEO is Vegan
If you want to make the maintenance guy happy, a basketball stadium must be around 10 Km.
The office dog "Pepe" needs a hairdresser every month. Ensure there's one not too far away.

I will try to find a nice place for them, and, I believe, the closest to spain would be the best, but, who knows! I will check a companies database in order to filter by several features of my choice, regarding their needs. For that I will make queries with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), I will use [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), I will use [MongoDB Geospatial Queries](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/geospatial-queries/) and I will also use [Google Cloud Api](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis) to obtain data about of the nearby
