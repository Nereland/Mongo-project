    "\n",
    "London is considered to be one of the world's most important global cities and has been called the **world's most powerful, most desirable, most influential, most visited, most expensive, sustainable, most investment-friendly,and most-popular-for-work city.** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It exerts a considerable impact upon the arts, commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services, **research and development**, tourism and transportation.London ranks 26th out of 300 major cities for economic performance.**It is one of the largest financial centres and has either the fifth- or the sixth-largest metropolitan area GDP.**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the most-visited city as measured by international arrivals and has the **busiest city airport system as measured by passenger traffic**.\n",
    "\n",
    "London has a diverse range of people and cultures, and more than 300 languages are spoken in the region.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The London Underground is the oldest underground railway network in the world.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A 2013 report by the City of London Corporation said that London is the **\"greenest city\" in Europe with 35,000 acres of public parks, woodlands and gardens.**  The largest parks in the central area of London are three of the eight Royal Parks, namely Hyde Park and its neighbour Kensington Gardens in the west, and Regent's Park to the north. Hyde Park in particular is popular for sports and sometimes hosts open-air concerts. Regent's Park contains London Zoo, the world's oldest scientific zoo, and is near Madame Tussauds Wax Museum. Primrose Hill, immediately to the north of Regent's Park, at 256 feet (78 m) is a popular spot from which to view the city skyline."
